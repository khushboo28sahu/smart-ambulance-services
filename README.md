# Summary

- In contemporary healthcare, there's a growing synergy between healthcare and emergency response systems to bolster patient care, particularly through smart-ambulance services. These services continually evolve to meet healthcare needs, requiring concurrent upgrades within hospitals for swift and efficient services.

- One key solution involves a multi-access solution for streaming ultra-high-definition video in the uplink from mobile systems. This solution intelligently divides and distributes video traffic across multiple network interfaces, incorporating inter-stream coding to ensure reliable transmission. The primary goal is to enhance and manage end-to-end delay and jitter performance in multi-access scenarios.

- A standardized set of APIs is proposed to access smart-ambulance services, providing live data for improved information utilization. This empowers hospital systems to be highly responsive and adaptable during critical situations in the pre-hospital and post-hospital phases of patient care.

- The implementation of these ideas at a product level is shared, along with real-world results. Detailed explanations of the front-end and back-end procedures are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in enhancing patient care and healthcare system responsiveness.
